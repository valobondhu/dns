##  What are the different types of DNS server?

All DNS servers fall into one of four categories: Recursive resolvers, [root nameservers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-root-server/), TLD nameservers, and authoritative nameservers. In a typical DNS lookup (when there is no [caching](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/) in play), these four DNS servers work together in harmony to complete the task of delivering the [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) for a specified [domain](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/) to the client (the client is usually a stub resolver - a simple resolver built into an operating system).

## What is a DNS recursive resolver?

![DNS recursive resolver](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/dns/dns-server-types/recursive-resolver.png)

A recursive resolver (also known as a DNS recursor) is the first stop in a DNS query. The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between a  client and a DNS nameserver. After receiving a DNS query from a web  client, a recursive resolver will either respond with cached data, or  send a request to a root nameserver, followed by another request to a  TLD nameserver, and then one last request to an authoritative  nameserver. After receiving a response from the authoritative nameserver containing the requested IP address, the recursive resolver then sends a response to the client.

During this process, the recursive resolver will cache information  received from authoritative name servers. When a client requests the IP  address of a domain name that was recently requested by another client,  the resolver can circumvent the process of communicating with the  nameservers, and just deliver the client the requested record from its  cache.

Most internet users use a recursive resolver provided by their ISP, but there are other options available; for example [Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/).

## What is a DNS root nameserver?

![DNS root nameserver](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/dns/dns-server-types/root-nameserver.png)

The 13 DNS root nameservers are known to every recursive resolver,  and they are the first stop in a recursive resolver’s quest for DNS  records. A root server accepts a recursive resolver’s query which  includes a domain name, and the root nameserver responds by directing  the recursive resolver to a TLD nameserver, based on the extension of  that domain (.com, .net, .org, etc.). The root nameservers are overseen  by a nonprofit called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and  Numbers (ICANN).

Note that while there are 13 root nameservers, that doesn’t mean that there are only 13 machines in the root nameserver system. There are 13  types of root nameservers, but there are multiple copies of each one all over the world, which use [Anycast routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) to provide speedy responses. If you added up all the instances of root  nameservers, you’d have 632 different servers (as of October 2016).

## What is a TLD nameserver?

![DNS TLD nameserver](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/dns/dns-server-types/tld-nameserver.png)

A TLD nameserver maintains information for all the domain names that  share a common domain extension, such as .com, .net, or whatever comes  after the last dot in a url.  For example, a .com TLD nameserver  contains information for every website that ends in ‘.com’. If a user  was searching for google.com, after receiving a response from a root  nameserver, the recursive resolver would then send a query to a .com TLD nameserver, which would respond by pointing to the authoritative  nameserver (see below) for that domain.

Management of TLD nameservers is handled by the Internet Assigned  Numbers Authority (IANA), which is a branch of ICANN. The IANA breaks up the TLD servers into two main groups:

- Generic top-level domains: These are domains that are  not country specific, some of the best-known generic TLDs include .com,  .org, .net, .edu, and .gov.
- Country code top-level domains: These include any  domains that are specific to a country or state. Examples include .uk,  .us, .ru, and .jp.

There is actually a third category for infrastructure  domains, but it is almost never used. This category was created for the  .arpa domain, which was a transitional domain used in the creation of  modern DNS; its significance today is mostly historical.

## What is an authoritative nameserver?

![DNS authoritative nameserver](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/dns/dns-server-types/authoritative-nameserver.png)

When a recursive resolver receives a response from a TLD nameserver,  that response will direct the resolver to an authoritative nameserver.  The authoritative nameserver is usually the resolver’s last step in the  journey for an IP address. The authoritative nameserver contains  information specific to the domain name it serves (e.g. google.com) and  it can provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server  found in the [DNS A record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/), or if the domain has a [CNAME record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) (alias) it will provide the recursive resolver with an alias domain, at which point the recursive resolver will have to perform a whole new DNS lookup to procure a record from an authoritative nameserver (often an A record containing an IP address). [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) distributes authoritative nameservers, which come with Anycast routing to make them more reliable.
